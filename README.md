# Customer prediction through Artificial neural networks
 This project uses deep learning to identify whether if a customer will leave a bank in the future or not. This prediction is made through various parameters such as age, gender, estimated salary of the customer. I worked on this project to get a better understanding deep learning to further understand more advanced concepts like convolutional neural networks.
